# git-util
Utility scripts for git. Scripts in the `path` directory can be put on the
`$PATH` and used as git commands. Scripts in the `misc` directory should not be
put on the path and may require direct editing of the script itself.

Disclaimer: Many of these scripts were taken or adapted from various sources,
which are mentioned at the top of each script when applicable.
